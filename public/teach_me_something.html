        <p style="width: 100%">
          These steps were designed based on my own experience and setup. There are various other ways to setup your
          very own
          bot, but this is the one I like the most.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>STEP 1 : Set up a Discord Account</h2>
      <p>
        Obviously, you will need a Discord account and your very own server to use and test your bot. If you haven't
        created
        an account yet go to <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord.com</a> and create one. If you do have one, log into
        it
        and open up a server that you want to use. Also make sure you're an Admin within this server for easier bot to
        server
        integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will also need an integrated development environment, I suggest downloading
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Visual Studio Code</a>
        to edit your code with.
      </p>
      <h2>STEP 2 : Download Node.JS</h2>
      <p>
        Node.js is an open source javascript runtime environment that you will need to run your javascript code. You can
        download it at
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodejs.org</a> and install it on your operating system. You can test if you
        successfully downloaded it by typing the following <u>separately</u> in your command line terminal :
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code class="method">npm</code><code> -v</code><br />
        <code class="method">node</code><code> -v</code>
      </div>
      <p>
        These should return the version of your installed npm (Javascript Package Manager) and node (Javascript Runtime
        Evironment).
      </p>
      <h2>STEP 3 : Get your Discord application token</h2>
      <p>
        The application token acts almost like an API key, a requirement needed for your code to communicate securely
        and
        properly with Discord's servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started go to
        <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me">discordapp.com/developers/applications/me</a>, hit
        <i>New Application</i>. Give it an appropriate name, then click the button marked <i>Save Changes</i>. On the
        right-hand menu, click <i>Bot</i>. Once in the menu click <i>Add Bot</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the box marked <i>App Bot User</i>, look for the phrase <i>Token: Click to Reveal</i>. Click it, and copy the
        text
        that appears. Also remember to <u>not share with anyone</u>; the token allows whoever posses it to take full
        control
        of your bot all under your account's name.
      </p>
      <h2>STEP 4 : Inviting your Discord Bot</h2>
      <p>
        Click on your bot’s page. Go to the <i>OAuth2</i> tab. Tick the <i>bot</i> checkbox under <i>scopes</i>. Tick
        the
        permissions required for your bot to function under <i>Bot Permissions</i>. Now the resulting URL can be used to
        add
        your bot to a server. Copy and paste the URL into your browser, choose a server to invite the bot to, and click
        “Authorize”.
